									</span>

									<p  class="partab">Queen Victoria became the Empress of India in 1785 after the two-year rebellion that ended control of the East India Company in the region. The rule of the British Crown otherwise known as the British Raj lasted until 1947, shortly after the Second World War. </p>
									<p class="partab">She obtained her first Indian servants in 1887, which was her golden jubilee year. They were presented in her Windsor castle and she was reportedly delighted. There were two men that stood out: Mohammed Bukhsh and  Abdul Karim. She quickly promoted Karim to become a munshi (secretary) from a waiter and then burned all of the pictures where Karim was handing her plates. He later taught her Hindustani which she wrote about in her diaries. (Hibbert 2000, 446)</p>
									<span class="image right"><img src="images/durbar.jpg" alt="" /> <p class="piccaption">Durbar state room in Osborne House</p> </span> 
									<p class="partab">Her household however, did not hold Karim in such high regard. They described him as infuriatingly pretentious and tiresome. The Queen viewed their dislike as racism toward the Munshi and did not take the advice of her household in this matter. When he was bedridden, the Queen herself went to visit him twice a day. </p>
									<p  class="partab">The ministers were worried about his closeness to the Queen, especially concerning confidential political material, however the Queen assured the ministers that he had never touched the political papers and that “he does not read English Fluently enough to be able to read anything of importance”.(Hibbert 2000, 448) </p>
									<p class="partab">Overall, there was a lot of controversy surrounding Karim and the household, however the Queen's fondness for him protected him from the view of others. It is this fondness toward him that led to her fascination with the Indian culture, including her new eating habits revolving around curry.(Baird 2016, 447)</p>
									<p class="partab">The Durbar Room in Osborne House has an Indian theme to commemorate the title of Queen Victoria as Empress of India. It was used to host dinners for European royalty and highlights that the Indian culture has made its way to high society.(English Heritage Society 2017)</p>

									<h2>Lipton Tea</h2>
									<span class="image left"><img src="images/lipton.jpg" alt="" /> <p class="piccaption"> Advertisement featuring an Indian woman in jewels, 1892</p> </span> 
									<p  class="partab">Lipton's Tea company advertisements often featured wealthy Indian women and men on their advertisements in order to seem like a moral business. It became one of the largest importers of tea into Britain, however their practices on the tea plantations were not beneficial towards the workers, even though they cut out the middlemen profits that drove prices up. </p>
									<p class="partab">The idea of tea being brought to Britain straight from the plantations appealed to  many and it was a central aspect of the advertising campaign. The slogan used was "directo from the Tea Garden to the Tea Pot" as seen at the top of the picture. </p>
									<p class="partab">The Lipton Tea company still exists today and supplies a vast amount of tea to the whole world. </p>
									<p  class="partab">The Ceylon region which the tea was imported from is currently part of Sri Lanka however it was part of the British colonies around India.(“Advertisement for Lipton’s Tea” 1892)</p>

									<h2>Veeraswamy and Co </h2>
									<span class="image right"><img src="images/veeraswamy.jpg" alt="" /> <p class="piccaption"> Punjabi Students at the restaurant, 1928</p> </span> 
									<p class="partab"> Veeraswamy and Co was a company that sold Indian food products in 1896 so they can be used in British and Western cooking. The company later opened the Veeraswamy Restaurant in  1926 which is still open today and was extremely popular with politicians and royalty.</p>
									<p class="partab">The restaurant was established by Indian Mughal princess and it has a stylish interior that still portrays the culture. It is still open inn London.</p>
									<p class="partab">Since 1977, it is no longer in the ownership of the original founders, however it still maintains its elegant and glamorous nature.(“Photograph of Punjabi Students at Veeraswamy’s Restuarant” 1928)</p>
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Koh-I-Noor</h2>
									<span class="image left"><img src="images/kohinoor.jpg" alt="" /> <p class="piccaption"> Published in the Indian Student Journal, 1937</p> </span> 
									<p class="partab">The advertisement of the Koh-i-noor restaurant in 1937 underlines that there was a growing presence of Indian establishments within the community and was popular with the increasing number of indian immigrants and the british officials that have returned from working in India. Additionally, they offered private parties and outside catering, which emphasizes the demand for the food.</p>
									<p class="partab">The Koh-I-Noor was originally a famous diamond that had a controversial journey to the Queens Crown. The royal Singh family were the owners of the diamond before the British.</p>
									<p class="partab">There are multiple restaurant advertisements that appeared in the newspapers around the time when immigration into the UK was increasing. (“Advertisement for the Koh-I-Noor Restuarant in London” 1937)</p>
