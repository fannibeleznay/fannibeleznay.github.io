                                        <p class="partab">Today curry is considered to be one of the most popular dishes in the UK however this was not always the case. Cultural appropriation and colonization have shaped the way this dish came to the UK. One important group of people in this story is the Anglo-Indians. An Anglo-Indian before 1911 referred to a British person living in India however after 1911 it referred to a person who has mixed heritage of British and Indian (Collingham 2006, 259). Almost all these Anglo-Indians were working in connection with the East India Company. Their return from their work in India was seen as a business opportunity for Sake Dean Mahomed. </p>
                                        <p class="partab">In 1810, Sake Dean Mahomed opened the first Indian restaurant in Britain called Hindostanee Coffee House. Sake Dean Mahomed represents one of the most well known early Indian Immigrants. He was born in 1759 in India and served as a trainee surgeon with the East India Company Bengal Army. When he was 25 he immigrated to Ireland where he met and married his wife, Jane. He spent time in London where he opened the coffee house but in 1814 he moved to Brighton where he became famous for opening the first medicated vapor bath house (“1814 - Doctor Brighton”).</p>
                                        <p class="partab">His coffee house was strategically located by where many fashionable Anglo-Indians lived by Portman Square on the corner of Charles Street and George Street. In 1811, on March 27th in the <i>Times</i> there was an advertisement for the newly opened Hindostanee Coffee House. It described that retired East India Company officials would now be able to enjoy “Indian dishes in the highest perfection” in their homeland” (Collingham 2006, 129). (See image). </p>

                                        </span>

                                        <p class="partab">The restaurant wanted to create an Indian ambiance. It was decorated with custom-made bamboo-cane chairs, paintings of Indian scenes and had a seperate smoking room (Collingham 2006, 129). The restaurant also had a few famous patrons. Most notably Charles Stewart, an East India Company officer nicknamed Hindoo Stewart and rumored to have 16 Indian wives. He opened the restaurant with the intent of attracting Anglo-Indians like William Makepeace Thackeray and other middle class men that had returned to England from working for the East India company, brought estates and often seats in parliament which gave them a place in the British social elite (Collingham 2006, 129-130).</p>
                                        <p class="partab">However, the success of the restaurant was short lived. After less than 2 years Mahomed filed for bankruptcy. His partner ended up carrying on the business for a few more years but it is unknown if the same Indian atmosphere continued but it is rather unlikely (Collingham 2006, 130).  There were multiple reasons why the business venture failed. The Hindostanee Coffee House was unable to compete with some of the other well established coffee houses which served curry among other things like Norris Street Coffee House and Haymarket. Another reason that added to the failure of Mahomed’s venture was that many of the Anglo-Indians could afford to have their own Indian cooks therefore no need to go to a coffee house to eat Indian food. When many of these people came back to Britain they brought their Indian servants with them which included cooks, nannies and manservants (Collingham 2006, 130-131). </p>
                                        <p class="partab">This was one of the ways many of the early Indian immigrants arrived in Britain.  However, many Indians tried to avoid immigrating to Britain or regretted coming. One of these was Ringa Swamee who had come to Britain with his employer. He described it as “[he] brought me to England fifteen years ago and then died and left me helpless.” He, his english wife and child were forced to beg after the death of his employer. (Collingham 2006, 131). Other people then the immigrants themselves as the effects of the journey. Joseph Salter, a missionary who worked with Asian immigrants, described the journey as disastrous for many of these immigrants who came as domestic servants. Many Indian servants put notices in the newspaper trying to find work with a family traveling to India so they could return home. On the other hand, there were also newspaper notices of people looking for Indian absconders. These people could easily disappear into the “Oriental quarter” which contained a network of boarding houses where many Indian sailors stayed while their ships were docked (Collingham 2006, 131). </p>
                                        <p class="partab">Another reason the restaurant failed was because they could often find cooks to hire that had been to India and knew how to cook curries (Collingham 2006, 131). However, servants traveling back and forth from India was not the only way these recipes came to Britain. Indian food also began to find its way back to England through other methods like letters sent back home from Brit's working in India for the East India Company. The families of these men were excited to learn about the exotic place their relative was in. Additionally, some women also went with their husbands to India. Many gathered collections of recipes and then took back to Britain when they went home (Collingham 2006, 133).</p>
                                        <p class="partab">Indian style recipes had long existed in Britain before they came popular and well recognized. In 1747, the first British cookbook containing Indian recipes was published. Hannah Glasse’s <i>The Art of Cookery</i> contained three different recipes for pilau (Collingham 2006, 133). However, these recipes were looked at favorably. In the beginning, curries were seen as a lower class form of stewed meat therefore they did not become popular with the middle class and truly enter British kitchens until the first half of the nineteenth century (Collingham 2006, 137). There were also other issues with perception of curries. The curries were originally viewed as a way to use up cold meat (also known as meat leftover from the previous day (Collingham 2017, 126). Nevertheless, the landscape began to change and curries began to slowly grow in popularity. In 1831, a pamphlet entitled “Indian Cookery” was published by the Oreintal Translation Committee. The Ango-Indian recipes it contained were closer to the traditional Indian ones that the later published Indian recipes. Then in the 1840s, curry was marketed as a health food. People like Edmund White, the marker of Selim’s Curry products, wrote a pamphlet called “Curries: their Healthful and Medicinal Qualities; their Importance in a Domestic, Commercial, and National Point of View” (Collingham 2006, 134, 136). </p>
                                        <p class="partab">By the 1850s curries had become part of the British culinary landscape; in <i>Modern Domestic Cookery</i> (1852) the author described curry as “formerly a dish almost exclusively for the tables of those who had made long residence in India, [it] is now so completely naturalized, that a few dinners thought complete unless one is on the table.” As the popularity rose, curry became a discussion for many women about the proper ways to prepare it, the best rice to eat it with and the authenticity of recipes. (Collingham 2006, 138-139).  However, these recipes were very different than the traditional Indian ones. Rakhal Halder, a Indian immigrant and professor of Sanskirt at University College London in the 1840s and 1850s thought the curries he had in England to be quite disagreeable. He describes “in consideration with my being Indian … as different from the genuine Indian curry as two things can possibly be” (Collingham 2006, 139).</p>
                                        <p class="partab">This was due to the adaptation that had been made as the recipes had been translated through cultures. The curries served to the Anglo-Indians in India had been anglicized for their palates. When these recipes were then brought back to Britain they underwent another level of anglicization (Collingham 2006, 139). The repeated levels of anglicization therefore made them contrast their traditional Indian counterpart. The Brits fell in love with these new anglicized curries. One of these was William Makepeace Thackeray, an Anglo-Indian who left India when he was four to get educated in Britain. In his time in Britain he discovered his love of curry. So much so the writer wrote a poem about it (Collingham 2006, 139).</p>

                                        <p class="partab">The poem describes one of the simple recipes to make a British style curry. These steps were used and widely accepted by many recipes. First, the onion and meat were fried in a pan with butter. Then, the curry powder and stock and/or milk was added. Finally, it was left to simmer and a bit of lemon juice was added before it was served. (Collingham 2006, 139-140). (In the extra content section of the website a link can be seen to a curry being prepared in this way.) This basic recipe was transformed by adding other ingredients to make variations. An example of one variation called “Bengal Chicken Curry” adds bengal chutnee, pickled limes and mangos to the base. Another version add grated coconut to create a “Melay Curry” (Collingham 2006, 140).</p>
                                        <div class="coloredbox">
                                            <p class="recipetext">
                                                Recipe for Bengal Chicken from Richard Terry’s <i>Indian Cookery</i><br>
                                                Cut into small dice 2 onions, and fry with 2 pats of butter: add your chicken cut into small joints, with one tablespoon of curry paste, ½ of powder, ½ of Bengal chutnee, ½ pickled lime, and ½ pickled mangos: stir the whole over a slow fire 10 minutes, cover the chicken with broth or water, and let simmer 1 ½ hours- by this time the curry will be almost dry- add 1 teaspoon of cream, and serve with rice, separate. 
                                                
                                            </p>
                                        </div>
                                        <p class="partab">Additionally, one of the things that also distinguished the British curries from the Indian was the creation and popularity of prepared curry powder. In the original Anglo-Indian recipes the cooks followed the traditional Indian principles of grinding the fresh spices. A similar idea was also seen in earlier recipes like in Hannah Glasse’s 1747 cookbook, the first British cookbook to include curry recipes. Her instruction read “Brown some Coriander Seeds over the Fire in a clean Shovel” and beat them into a power. (Collingham 2006, 140-141).</p>
                                        <p class="partab">However, this idea did not continue into later recipes as they became anglicized. By the 1850s, British cookbooks no longer called for the freshly ground spices instead they called for a spice mix called “curry powder”. Some cookbooks offered a list of pre ground spices that could be mixed together to make curry powder however because curry was growing in popularity premixed versions were also available. Companies like Sorlie’s Perfumery Warehouse in Piccadilly were selling this premixed curry powder as early as 1784 despite it not being widely popular yet (Collingham 2006, 141). The creation of curry powder helped to further anglicize curry. It also causes the curry to lose its “delicate nuances” despite making the spices easier to find and therefore more available (Collingham 2006, 141).</p>
                                        <p class="partab">Other elements were also lost in the anglicization of curry. In traditional Indian cooking, the spices were added individually at different times to the cooking oil to bring out the different flavors. However it was customary in British curry to add the curry powder at the same time as the water or stock (Collingham 2006, 142-143). The British curries also had a different  texture. Often the curries were thickened with a roux of flour mixed with a little curry powder. Indian curries never used flour like this and instead if they wanted to thicken it they would use an ingredient like coconut cream (Collingham 2006, 143).</p>
                                        <p class="partab">Furthermore, they also anglicized some of the ingredients. Most cooks used lemon juice instead of the traditional Indian tamarind as well as apples to replace mangos and cucumber to replace bitter gourds (Collingham 2006, 141). These ingredients were easier for Brits to find since natively existed in the country. The British made curry into an “economical and convenient dish” (Collingham 2017, 126). The two styles of curry were very distinct especially to the palates of those native to both India and the UK. Matty Robinson, the bride of an British Army Officer, describes her encounter with Ango-Indian curry on her arrival in Bombay in 1858. She wrote “I can’t touch the Indian fruits or the fish which they say is so delicious, and as to the curries it makes me sick to think of them; give me an English one!” (Collingham 2006, 144).</p>
